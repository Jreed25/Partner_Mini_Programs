# Partner_Mini_Programs

# In this program there are 5 different choices for the user to make.
# 4 Different mini programs to run and 1 choice for exiting the program.

# This was a partner project in an assembly language class I had 
# where me and my partner each did 2 of the programs.
# Unfortunately, he was the one submitting and I never got the full program, 
# but I do have the parts I did and the parts we worked on together.
